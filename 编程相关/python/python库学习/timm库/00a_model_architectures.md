# Model Architectures (WIP)
The model architectures included come from a wide variety of sources. Sources, including papers, original impl ("reference code") that [Ross](https://twitter.com/wightmanr) rewrote / adapted, and PyTorch impl that he leveraged directly ("code") are listed below.
Most included models have pretrained weights. The weights are either:
1. from their original sources
2. ported by myself from their original impl in a different framework (e.g. Tensorflow models)
3. trained from scratch using the included training script
The validation results for the pretrained weights can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/tree/main/results).
